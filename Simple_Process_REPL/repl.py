"""
This is a repl/interpreter with almost no syntax.
It currently recognizes words, strings and numbers.

The symbol tables are defined by the user.  To start,
symbols which point to functions should be added to the symbol
table.  From there, new symbols can be made by listing symbols
together.  This is a poor mans lisp with no parentheses.

There are two symbol tables. One is a table of what could
be considered keywords to invoke functions, or lists of keywords
which ultimately invoke functions.

The other is a table of special symbols which take parameters.
specials are functions which take arguments. Since we really have
no syntax this is a difficulty. Specials operate on the entire
command line and cannot be listed together like the normal
symbols can. Finding a special consists of looking up the first
word in the command, if found the special is evaluated with
parameters given. If the command is not a special, it is passed
on to be evaluated by normal symbol processing.

The two specials defined here are 'def' and 'set'. def allows
the creation of a new symbol in the symbol table, interactively
from the repl.  ie. 'def some-new-command 'help string' some list
of known symbols'

In the user space, save and load a configuration file is at least recommended
so that a configuration can be saved or loaded from the repl.

The symbol table is the lookup table for any functions you wish
to use in the repl, or in evaluating process strings.

A symbol is one of two things.
1. A function which will take no arguments or they are
provided in the symbol definition.  Arguments are not rebound.
2. A string of symbols.

It is possible to expose any functionality you wish, with these
limitations.

 Example:
 import repl as r
 symbols = [
     ['wifi', connect_wifi, 'Connect to wifi using nmtui if not connected.']
     ['list', P.list_usb,   'List the particle boards connected to USB.']
     ['start', 'wifi list', 'Connect wifi and list the boards.']
 ]
 r.init_symbol_table(symbols)

The specials table exists because it's handy to do things that take arguments.
like loading or saving a config file or defining a new symbol.
The normal symbols cannot be mixed with the special symbols, although
it should be possible to create a symbol which invokes a special in
a static argument manner.

If the number of args is -1 that indicates a varargs function and
the number of args will not be validated.

    ['name', function, nargs, 'helpstr']

    ['def', def_symbol, -1,
     "Define a new function; def <name> 'helpstr' <list of commands>"]
